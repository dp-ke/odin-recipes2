        <li>30g cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>60g caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 large free-range eggs</li>
        <li>180ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Chocolate chunks, mini marshmallows and biscuit crumbs to serve (optional; see tips)</li>

     <ul>
        <li>200g Nutella</li>
        <li>125ml double cream</li>

     </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour, cocoa, baking powder, sugar and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl, then whisk to combine. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, whisk in the eggs, then pour over the milk and whisk again until smooth and combined. Rest the batter in the fridge for 30 minutes (see Make Ahead)</li>
        <li>To make the chocolate sauce, gently heat the Nutella and cream in a pan, stirring until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat (see tip). Re-warm to melt again before serving, if needed.</li>
        <li>3 Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, add a little oil and use a pastry brush or kitchen paper to wipe it across the base of the pan. Scoop small ladlefuls of batter into the pan and cook for about 1 minute on each side. Set aside, covered, to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding a little more oil to the pan as needed (see Make Ahead).</li>
        <li>Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the pancakes and serve sprinkled with a rocky road topping if you like (see tip).</li>
